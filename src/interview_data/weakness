You may get lucky and have a more enlightened interviewer but I recommend that every candidate be prepared with a good answer to the weakness question just in case. I've seen many great candidates get tripped up by the weakness question. It can be very difficult to talk about your flaws in a stressful situation like a job interview. Negative topics require added diplomacy. Meanwhile, you're nervous and thinking about a thousand other things. Is my hair sticking up? Is my breath okay? Why did he just frown like that?



What am I going to say if he asks why I left my last job? However, there is a way to answer that is honest and authentic and still increases your odds of getting a job offer. A good weakness answer has two important parts. Part one is your weakness. Briefly describe a real weakness that wouldn't be a major handicap on the job. We'll help you choose a good weakness in a minute. Part two is how you're already working on that weakness. Part two is a critical component. Discuss your proactive efforts to improve.


This shows that you're self-aware, have a drive to be your best, and that the weakness will not slow you down. So now let's talk about how to choose a good weakness. First, you want to be authentic. Don't select a weakness just because it sounds good. You'll make a better impression with sincerity. That doesn't mean you have to share a weakness that makes you look bad. If you're like most of us, you have several weaknesses, and at least one of them will be interview-friendly. You also want to pick a weakness that's acceptable for the job at hand.

Be aware of the job requirements and don't cite a weakness related to any of the required skills or desired qualities. If you're an accountant, don't talk about hating math or a lack of attention to detail. If you're in sales, don't confess to being too reserved or lacking persistence. Next, select a weakness that is relatively minor and fixable. By fixable, I mean, it's something you could improve through work and motivation. For example, fixable is "I get nervous when speaking in front of large groups."


You can get better through practice and learning new skills. And this is a common development area. Harder to fix, "I'm very shy and often have trouble speaking up in meetings." While there's nothing wrong with being shy, but an interviewer might assume that the candidate would have trouble collaborating in a team environment. Next tip, describe your weakness in a concise, neutral way. Don't feel like you have to go into great detail. Be brief. And most importantly, avoid being defensive or overly negative. Then it's on to part two. Demonstrate that you are working on your weakness.



In the second part of your answer, you need to describe how you have already taken steps to improve in your area of weakness. Here is why. One, a great candidate is always looking for ways to learn and grow. Two, a fabulous candidate then takes the initiative to improve. Use your answer to demonstrate your motivation to be the best at what you do. This is how to truly emphasize the positive when talking about your weakness. Okay, so now let's look at some examples of strong answers

to what is your greatest weakness.

- [Woman] I think, one area I could work on is my delegation skills. I'm always so concerned about everything being done right and on time that I can get stuck in the mentality of "If you want it done right, do it yourself." Unfortunately, that's not always possible and I've realized that I can slow things down if I'm too controlling. I learned this recently when given the opportunity to manage the department's summer interns. I had never managed direct reports before so, this was a hugely educational experience in many different ways. It definitely taught me how to delegate and my manager noticed the difference in my management style at the end of the summer. I know I can benefit from additional development in this area, so I signed up for a management skills training course and I'm always looking for opportunities to manage projects for our group. 


- This is a good example for a junior-level employee, in a world in which delegation abilities are not critical. Please note that the last sentence in the first paragraph is important because it acknowledges how the weakness can be a problem and why it's worth working on. The weakness is acknowledged and described. But the emphasis is more on how the candidate has sought out ways to improve. Keep in mind that this is not such a terrific answer if you're applying for a job that requires you to manage people.


- [Man 1] Sometimes I can be a bit too honest when I provide feedback to co-workers. My personality is naturally very straightforward and to-the-point and most of my colleagues really value that. But I've learned that there are times on the job when more diplomacy is required. I took a training class on conflict management and it really opened my eyes to the need to communicate differently with different people. So now I'm much better at providing constructive feedback even if it doesn't always come naturally. 

- This weakness is described well. The candidate notes how directness has been a weakness while also making it clear that he is not a raging jerk to his coworkers. And in the second part, he talks about concrete steps he has taken and how he has improved. 



- [Man 2] Honestly, I would say that public speaking is an area that I can work on. I tend to get nervous when asked to present to a large group of people. In small team meetings, I'm the first one to stand up and present, but put me in front of a big group, and I get flustered. I've been making an effort to get more comfortable with this. Recently, I volunteered to lead a training for a group of about 40 volunteers at the literacy program. I was nervous but I did it and got positive feedback. It was actually kind of fun. So I plan on continuing to seek out opportunities to improve in this area.

- Fear of public speaking is a common fear. In this sample answer, the candidate makes it clear that he has no trouble communicating in general, which could be a red flag. It's just getting up in front of a big group that scares him. He goes on to describe how he identified the weakness, spoke with his manager about it and then took proactive steps to improve. He even has a little triumph at the end.



And now a few words about what not to do. Here are the mistakes that candidates typically make and you may be able to relate. First, trying to turn a negative into a positive. You'll find many articles that advise you to turn a negative into a positive by sharing a supposed weakness that is actually a desirable quality. A few examples. I'm too much of a perfectionist. I work too hard. I care too much about my work. It's an old trick and the interviewer sees right through it.



In fact, this approach will likely make her think you're hiding something. Second thing to avoid, refusing to answer the question. Some candidates will assert that they can't think of a single weakness. This is probably because they freeze up and are afraid to say the wrong thing. But this answer also makes you look like you're hiding something or you're just not at all self-aware. And finally, revealing a weakness that raises red flags. Another mistake is to be too candid and confess to a weakness that would hinder your ability to excel in the role.


I once had a coaching client answer, "I have trouble getting up in the morning and getting to work on time." His real weakness was that he was way too honest. Okay, so that brings us to the end of this lesson on answering interview questions about your weaknesses. Now you're ready to come up with a strong answer about your own weaknesses. Then, you'll never have to stress about these dreaded questions again.
