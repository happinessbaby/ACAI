[32;1m[1;3mPositive Feedback: 
- The candidate correctly identified the process of creating a set in Tableau by using the "Create Set" button when right-clicking a dimensional value. They also mentioned that multiple dimensions can be selected at the same time, which shows an understanding of the functionality of sets in Tableau.

Negative Feedback:
- The candidate did not provide a complete answer for the third question. While they mentioned that data blending is used to combine data from different sources, they did not provide any further explanation or details about how data blending works in Tableau. It would have been helpful to provide more information about the process and benefits of data blending in Tableau.[0m
