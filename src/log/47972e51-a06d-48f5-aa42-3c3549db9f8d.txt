[32;1m[1;3mI have access to several tools that can assist me during the interview process. Here are some of the tools I can use:

1. search_interview_material: This tool allows me to search for interview content that may contain relevant information for the current interview.

2. search_resume: This tool allows me to search for personal information about the applicant, which can help me tailor the interview questions and responses.

3. search_job_posting: This tool allows me to search for job-specific information, such as the job description and requirements, which can help me ask relevant interview questions.

4. interview_stopper: This tool allows me to end the interview process if the user requests to end the session or go back to the main chat.

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.[0m
