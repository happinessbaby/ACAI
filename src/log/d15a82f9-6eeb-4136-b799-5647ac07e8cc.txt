Tableau Desktop Professional is the cornerstone product that allows users to access the other Tableau products. Additionally, there are Tableau Public Premium and Tableau Reader, which offer additional features for sharing and viewing visualizations.

Tableau offers several products, including:

1. Tableau Desktop Professional: This is the main product that allows users to access other Tableau products. It provides a comprehensive set of features for data visualization and analysis.

2. Tableau Server: This is a business intelligence system that provides secure access to enterprise data and user interaction via web portals on a company intranet. It requires Tableau Desktop Professional.

3. Tableau Online: This is a hosted solution for storing and accessing data dashboards in the cloud. It is geared towards consultants and companies and also requires Tableau Desktop Professional.

4. Tableau Public: This is a free application and visualization hosting service for sharing publicly available data on the web. It is a great option for journalists and bloggers. It can be used as a standalone Windows application or published via Tableau Desktop Professional.

In addition to these products, there are Tableau Public Premium and Tableau Reader. Tableau Public Premium is an annual subscription service that allows customers to prevent viewers of visualizations hosted on Tableau Public from downloading the workbook and accessing the underlying data. Tableau Reader is a free Windows application that allows users to open saved Tableau workbook files and view and interact with visualizations.

Tableau Desktop Professional allows users to connect to various types of data sources, including files such as Excel and Access, traditional relational databases like MySQL and Oracle, Hadoop technologies, and cloud sources like Google Analytics and Salesforce. Tableau Desktop Personal and Tableau Public have more limited data source connectivity options.

The Tableau user interface consists of sheets and dashboards. Sheets are used for creating individual visualizations, while dashboards are used for combining sheets and other objects like images, text, and web pages.

Tableau uses VizQL, a visual query language, to convert drag-and-drop actions into data queries, allowing users to quickly find and share insights in their data.

Overall, Tableau is a powerful tool for data visualization and analysis, with various products and features to suit different needs and use cases.[0m
