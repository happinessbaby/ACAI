{'score': 0.75, 'reasoning': "i. The final answer is helpful to an extent. The AI model correctly identifies that it needs more information (the user's resume) to proceed with the evaluation. However, it does not provide any guidance on how the user can provide their resume, which could be a point of confusion.\n\nii. The AI language model uses a logical sequence of tools to answer the question. Given the user's request to evaluate their resume, the model correctly chooses to use the resume_evaluator tool.\n\niii. The AI language model uses the tool in a helpful way. It correctly formats the input for the resume_evaluator tool, although it uses placeholder values because the user has not provided the necessary information.\n\niv. The AI language model does not use too many steps to answer the question. It only uses one step, which is appropriate for the question asked.\n\nv. The appropriate tool is used to answer the question. The user asked for help evaluating their resume, and the model correctly chose to use the resume_evaluator tool.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would give the AI language model a score of 4 out of 5. It correctly identifies the need for more information and uses the appropriate tool, but it could provide more guidance to the user on how to provide their resume."}

 should be revised to handle requests for resume evaluation. If a user asks for help with evaluating their resume, the assistant should guide them on how to share their resume for evaluation. If it's not possible to evaluate a specific document, the assistant should provide general tips on resume writing. Additionally, the assistant should be prepared to handle repetitive greetings from the user without getting stuck in a greeting loop.
