{'score': 0.0, 'reasoning': 'i. Is the final answer helpful?\nThe final answer is not very helpful. The user asked about a specific tool, "faiss_resume", but the AI model responded with a generic response about not having direct access to tools. It did not provide any specific information about the "faiss_resume" tool.\n\nii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?\nThe AI model did not use any tools to answer the question. It threw an exception, indicating that it did not understand the user\'s question or how to use the tools to answer it.\n\niii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?\nThe AI model did not use any tools in this case, so it did not use them in a helpful way.\n\niv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?\nThe AI model only used one step, which was an exception. This indicates that it did not understand the user\'s question or how to use the tools to answer it.\n\nv. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?\nThe AI model did not use any tools to answer the question. It should have used the "redis_general" tool to look up information about the "faiss_resume" tool, as this is a general purpose database that could potentially contain this information.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would give the AI model a score of 1 out of 5. It did not understand the user\'s question, did not use any tools to answer it, and provided a generic response that did not address the user\'s specific query.'}
