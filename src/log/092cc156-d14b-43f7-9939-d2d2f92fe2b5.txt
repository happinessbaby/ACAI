1. Tableau Basics: Familiarize yourself with the Tableau interface, including the different components such as worksheets, dashboards, and stories. Understand how to connect to data sources and create visualizations.

2. Data Connections: Learn how to connect Tableau to various data sources, such as Excel, CSV files, databases, and cloud platforms. Understand how to join and blend data from multiple sources.

3. Data Visualization: Gain knowledge of different chart types and when to use them. Understand how to create basic visualizations like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps. Learn about formatting options, adding labels, and customizing colors.

4. Calculations and Expressions: Explore Tableau's calculation functions and understand how to create calculated fields and measures. Learn about aggregations, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

5. Filters and Parameters: Understand how to use filters to refine data and control what is displayed in your visualizations. Learn about creating parameters to allow users to interact with the data and customize their views.

6. Dashboards and Stories: Learn how to create interactive dashboards by combining multiple visualizations. Understand how to add interactivity, actions, and filters to enhance the user experience. Explore Tableau's storytelling capabilities to create compelling narratives with your data.

7. Tableau Server and Tableau Public: Familiarize yourself with Tableau's server-based solutions for sharing and collaborating on visualizations. Learn about publishing workbooks, creating user permissions, and embedding visualizations in websites.

It's also a good idea to practice using Tableau by working on sample datasets and creating different types of visualizations. Additionally, reviewing case studies and real-world examples of Tableau implementations can help you understand how the tool is used in different industries.
