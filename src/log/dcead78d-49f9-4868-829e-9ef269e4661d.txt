{'score': 0.75, 'reasoning': "i. Is the final answer helpful?\nThe final answer is helpful to an extent. The user's question was vague, and the AI model asked for clarification, which is a reasonable response.\n\nii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?\nThe AI model did not use any tools in this instance. Given the vagueness of the user's question, it was not clear which tool would be appropriate to use.\n\niii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?\nThe AI model did not use any tools in this instance.\n\niv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?\nThe AI model used a single step to answer the question, which is appropriate given the nature of the question.\n\nv. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?\nGiven the vagueness of the user's question, it was not clear which tool would be appropriate to use.

This will allow you to provide more specific and helpful advice. You can also provide general advice on how to structure a cover letter and what information to include.
{'score': 0.75, 'reasoning': "i. The final answer is helpful to an extent. The AI model correctly identifies that it needs more information (the user's resume) to generate a cover letter. However, it could have been more helpful by also asking for the specific job and company the user is applying to, as these are also required inputs for the cover_letter_generator tool.\n\nii. The AI language model uses a logical sequence of tools to answer the question. It correctly identifies that the cover_letter_generator tool is the most appropriate tool to use based on the user's request for help writing a cover letter.\n\niii. The AI language model uses the tool in a helpful way. It correctly formats the input for the cover_letter_generator tool, although it does not fill in the specific details because it does not have them. The tool's output is a request for the user's resume, which the AI model correctly interprets and communicates to the user.\n\niv. The AI language model does not use too many steps to answer the question. It uses just one step, which is appropriate for the question.\n\nv. The appropriate tool is used to answer the question. The user asked for help writing a cover letter, and the AI model correctly identified and used the cover_letter_generator tool.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would give the AI language model a score of 4 out of 5. It correctly identified and used the appropriate tool, and it communicated effectively with the user. However, it could have been more helpful by also asking for the specific job and company the user is applying to."}
