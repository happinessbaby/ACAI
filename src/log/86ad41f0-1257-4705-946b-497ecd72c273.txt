[32;1m[1;3mGreat! Now that I have your resume, let's proceed with the redesigning process. I'll use the "redesign_resume_template" tool to create a new template for your resume. Here's the JSON input for the tool:

```json
{
    "action": "redesign_resume_template",
    "action_input": "{\"resume_file\":\"./static/86ad41f0-1257-4705-946b-497ecd72c273/528d1504-ec60-427e-9464-2c03fae17ff3.txt\"}"
}
```[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe response to your last comment is that the best format for your resume redesign would be a "functional" format. This format focuses on your skills and experience, rather than on your chronological work history. It's typically used by job seekers who are changing careers or who have gaps in their employment history. 

Now, let's proceed with rewriting your resume using this new functional template. Here's the JSON input for the "resume_writer" tool:

```json
{
    "action": "resume_writer",
    "action_input": "{\"resume_file\":\"./static/86ad41f0-1257-4705-946b-497ecd72c273/528d1504-ec60-427e-9464-2c03fae17ff3.txt\", \"resume_template_file\":\"functional\"}"
