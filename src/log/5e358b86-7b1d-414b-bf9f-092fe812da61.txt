[32;1m[1;3mI have access to several tools that can assist with the interview process. Some of the tools include:

1. search_interview_material: This tool allows me to search for interview content and retrieve information related to specific questions or topics.

2. search_resume: This tool allows me to access personal information about the applicant, such as their qualifications, skills, and work experience.

3. search_job_posting: This tool allows me to retrieve job-specific information, such as the job description, required qualifications, and responsibilities.

4. interview_stopper: This tool is used to end the interview process when the user requests or implies that they want to end the session.

Please let me know if there is a specific tool you would like me to use or if you have any other questions.[0m
