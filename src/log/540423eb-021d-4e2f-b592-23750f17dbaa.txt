[32;1m[1;3mFeedback: It seems like you're not familiar with the difference between a .twb and a .twbx file in Tableau. A .twb file is a Tableau workbook file that contains references to data sources and visualizations, but does not include the actual data. On the other hand, a .twbx file is a packaged workbook file that includes both the workbook and the data sources, making it easier to share and distribute. It's important to understand this difference when working with Tableau.[0m
