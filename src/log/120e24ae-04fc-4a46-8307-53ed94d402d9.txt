[32;1m[1;3mSure, I can help you with that. To rewrite your resume using a new template, we will first need to create a new template using the `redesign_resume_template` tool. This tool will take your existing resume and job post file (if you have one) and create a new template. 

Here is the JSON input for the `redesign_resume_template` tool:

```json
{
    "action": "redesign_resume_template",
    "action_input": "{\"resume_file\":\"./static/120e24ae-04fc-4a46-8307-53ed94d402d9/60b1d929-9ee3-4d76-88b8-e747e2a7068c.txt\", \"job_post_file\":\"\"}"
}
```

Once we have the new template, we can use the `resume_writer` tool to rewrite your resume using the new template.[0m[32;1m[1;3m[0m
