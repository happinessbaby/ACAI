[32;1m[1;3mSure, I can help you with that. To rewrite your resume using a new template, we will use the `redesign_resume_template` tool to create a new template and then the `resume_writer` tool to rewrite your resume. 

First, let's create a new template. Here is the JSON blob for the `redesign_resume_template` tool:

```json
{
    "action": "redesign_resume_template",
    "action_input": "{\"resume_file\":\"./static/e25c8f3d-0e5f-4cda-b430-8606c7e419ce/846f02d7-4367-421a-96de-dc32656ecb27.txt\"}"
}
```

Once we have the new template, we will use the `resume_writer` tool to rewrite your resume. I will provide the JSON blob for that tool once we have the new template.[0m[32;1m[1;3m[0m
