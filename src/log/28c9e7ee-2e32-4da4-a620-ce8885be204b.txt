[0m[32;1m[1;3mI'm sorry, but I am an interview grader and my purpose is to evaluate responses to interview questions. I am not able to evaluate resumes. If you have any specific interview questions or need assistance with interview preparation, I would be happy to help.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mI apologize for any confusion, but as an AI interviewer, my role is to ask interview questions and provide feedback on the responses. I am not able to directly evaluate resumes. However, I can provide guidance and tips on how to improve your resume if you'd like. Would you like some assistance with that?[0m
