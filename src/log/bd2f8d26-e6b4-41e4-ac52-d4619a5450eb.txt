To create a fixed set in Tableau, you can select one or more marks in your visualization, right-click on them, and choose 'Create Set'. To create a dynamic set, you can navigate to the Data pane, right-click on a field, and select 'Create > Set'. Sets in Tableau are useful for filtering, highlighting, and comparing subsets of your data."
