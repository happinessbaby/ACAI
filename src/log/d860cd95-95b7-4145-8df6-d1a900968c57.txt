ease upload your resume? This will help me assist you better in evaluating it."
{'score': 0.75, 'reasoning': "i. Is the final answer helpful?\nThe final answer is helpful as it asks the user to provide the necessary information (resume file) to proceed with the evaluation. However, it could have been more helpful if the model also asked for the job and company details, as these are required inputs for the resume_evaluator tool. \n\nii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?\nYes, the AI model uses a logical sequence of tools. The user asked for help in evaluating their resume, and the model chose the resume_evaluator tool, which is the appropriate tool for this task.\n\niii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?\nYes, the AI model uses the resume_evaluator tool in a helpful way. It correctly inputs the required JSON format, although it uses placeholders instead of actual data because the user didn't provide any specific details.\n\niv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?\nNo, the AI model uses only one step to answer the question, which is appropriate for this task.\n\nv. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?\nYes, the appropriate tool (resume_evaluator) is used to answer the question.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would give the AI model a score of 4 out of 5. It correctly identified and used the appropriate tool, but it could have been more helpful by asking the user for all the necessary details (job, company, resume file, and job post link) instead of just the resume file."}

If the user repeats a greeting, acknowledge the repetition and try to steer the conversation towards a productive path. When a user asks for help with their resume, offer to provide tips or ask for specific areas where they want help. If necessary, ask for the resume file for a more detailed evaluation.
