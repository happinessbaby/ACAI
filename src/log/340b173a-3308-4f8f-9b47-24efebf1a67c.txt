Data blending and data joining are two different methods of combining data in Tableau. 

Data blending is a method used when the data is not in one place, but rather spread across multiple sources. It allows you to combine data from those different sources and view it together on a single dashboard. The data remains in their original sources and the blend happens at the visualization level. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets as it doesn't require moving or transforming the data.

On the other hand, data joining is used when you have related data in different tables of a single source and you want to combine them into a single table. The join can be inner, left, right, or full-outer, depending on which records you want in your final table. This operation happens at the data source level.

Remember, the choice between data blending and data joining in Tableau depends on your specific needs and the structure of your data.[0m[32;1m[1;3m```json
