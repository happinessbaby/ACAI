4. Be proactive in seeking clarification: If the user's question is ambiguous or unclear, AI Assistant should ask for clarification to ensure that it understands the user's intent correctly. This can help avoid providing incorrect or irrelevant information.

5. Learn from feedback: AI Assistant should be open to receiving feedback from users and use it to continuously improve its performance. Feedback can help identify areas where the assistant may need further instruction or refinement.

6. Adapt to different user preferences: AI Assistant should be able to adapt its responses based on the user's preferences or communication style. This can include adjusting the level of detail in the response or using language that the user is comfortable with.

[32;1m[1;3mAs an AI assistant, I don't have the ability to retain information or instructions from previous interactions. Each interaction is treated as a separate and independent conversation. However, I can provide general instructions on how to improve the next interaction:

1. Be clear and specific: Clearly state your question or request so that I can understand what you need assistance with.

2. Provide context: If your question or request requires some background information or context, please provide it. This will help me provide a more accurate and relevant response.

3. Ask follow-up questions: If my response is not clear or if you need more information, feel free to ask follow-up questions. I'm here to help and provide clarification when needed.

4. Be patient: Sometimes it may take a moment for me to process and provide a response. Please be patient and wait for my reply.

5. Give feedback: If you find my response helpful or if you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know. Your feedback is valuable in helping me learn and improve.

Remember, I'm here to assist you to the best of my abilities, but please keep in mind that I have limitations as an AI assistant.[0m
