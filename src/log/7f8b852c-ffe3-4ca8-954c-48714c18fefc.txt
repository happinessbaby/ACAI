Invoking: `quiz_interview` with `Tableau`


[0m[32;1m[1;3mTableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. It is used to analyze and visualize data in an interactive and intuitive way. Tableau is based on three simple concepts:

1. Connect: Tableau allows you to connect to various data sources such as databases, spreadsheets, and cloud services. You can easily import and combine data from multiple sources to create a unified view.

2. Analyze: Once the data is connected, Tableau provides a wide range of analytical tools and functions to explore and analyze the data. You can perform calculations, create custom calculations, apply filters, and create visualizations to gain insights from the data.

3. Share: Tableau allows you to share your analysis and visualizations with others. You can create interactive dashboards and reports that can be published and accessed by others. Tableau also provides options to embed visualizations in websites or share them via email.

Tableau Engine is the core component of Tableau that processes and analyzes the data. It performs tasks such as data extraction, data transformation, and data visualization.
