{'score': 0.75, 'reasoning': "i. The final answer is helpful to an extent. The AI model correctly identified that it needs more information (the user's resume) to proceed with the evaluation. However, it could have been more helpful by also asking for the specific job and company the user is interested in, as these are also required inputs for the resume_evaluator tool.\n\nii. The AI model uses a logical sequence of tools to answer the question. Given the user's request to evaluate their resume, the model correctly chose to use the resume_evaluator tool.\n\niii. The AI model uses the tool in a helpful way. It correctly formatted the JSON input for the resume_evaluator tool, although it did not fill in the specific details as these were not provided by the user.\n\niv. The AI model does not use too many steps to answer the question. It directly used the appropriate tool in response to the user's request.\n\nv. The appropriate tool was used to answer the question. The user asked for help evaluating their resume, and the model correctly chose to use the resume_evaluator tool.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would give the AI model a score of 4 out of 5. It correctly identified and used the appropriate tool, but it could have been more helpful by also asking for the specific job and company the user is interested in, as these are also required inputs for the resume_evaluator tool."}
