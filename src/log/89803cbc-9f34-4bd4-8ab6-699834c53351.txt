[32;1m[1;3mSure, I can help you with that. To rewrite your resume using a new template, we will use the `redesign_resume_template` tool first to create a new template. Then, we will use the `resume_writer` tool to rewrite your resume according to the new template. 

Let's start with the first step. Here is the JSON blob for the `redesign_resume_template` tool:

```json
{
    "action": "redesign_resume_template",
    "action_input": "{\"resume_file\":\"./static/89803cbc-9f34-4bd4-8ab6-699834c53351/92ff7744-0680-42a7-a60b-e7d571502333.txt\"}"
}
