    "action_input": "I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. To help you prepare for a job interview, you should follow these steps: \n\n1. Research the company and the job role thoroughly. You can do this by visiting the company's website, checking out their social media pages, and reading about the job role and responsibilities. \n\n2. Prepare answers for common interview questions. These might include questions about your strengths and weaknesses, your experience, and why you're interested in the job and the company. \n\n3. Practice your responses to these questions. You can do this by rehearsing in front of a mirror or with a friend. \n\n4. Dress appropriately for the interview. This usually means wearing business or business casual attire, unless the company specifies otherwise. \n\n5. Arrive early to the interview location. This will give you time to relax and prepare before the interview starts. \n\n6. Be confident and maintain eye contact during the interview. This shows the interviewer that you're engaged and interested in the conversation. \n\n7. Send a thank you note after the interview. This is a nice way to show your appreciation for the opportunity to interview. \n\nI hope these tips help you prepare for your job interview. Good luck!"
