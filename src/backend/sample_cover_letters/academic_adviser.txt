Dear Hiring Manager,

It is a pleasure to be applying for the Academic Advisor position at River Tech. As someone with an extensive background in education, I am well-equipped to provide students with guidance throughout their college career. My passion for education makes me confident in my ability to fulfill the role of Academic Advisor at River Tech.

During my tenure as an Academic Advisor at Coral Springs University, I worked with a student body of 3,000 students and was directly assigned to 1,000 of those students per year. My responsibilities included making course schedules for each student every semester, addressing student concerns, and meeting with students to discuss change of major, program evaluations, and grade concerns.

I pay close attention to the needs of students and those of my coworkers. I make it a priority to put the needs of others first and to always meet deadlines. I am well-aware of the careful planning and dedication it takes to be an Academic Advisor. My abilities stem from my education at Hawaii Western University. My degree in secondary education with a minor in psychology taught me the knowledge needed to properly advise students. Throughout my career, I have made a point to be the Academic Advisor I wish I had around when I was a student in college. I am willing to do what it takes to ensure the success of my students.

I would like to thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and the responsibilities of your Academic Advising team. With my education and previous experience, I am confident in my ability to deliver as an Academic Advisor.

Sincerely,

Ebony Moore
