Dear Hiring Manager,

It is a pleasure to be applying for the Account Executive position at Crane & Jenkins. As an experienced Account Executive with a formidable education, I am confident in my ability to perform in this role at Crane & Jenkins.

During my previous role at River Tech, I was responsible for meeting with clients to determine their advertising needs, working with account planners to create campaigns, presenting ideas and cost to clients, working with the creative team on adverts, managing the client's account, and invoicing. I prioritized client satisfaction and efficiently resolved any conflicts that arose. I take pride in my work and strive to maintain a friendly and professional manner at all times.

My education at Longford Tech served as the foundation for my abilities. I obtained two bachelor's degrees; one in business and one in marketing. During the course of my academic career I studied advertising, marketing, statistics, communication, media, business management, and psychology. I believe that the acquisition of these skills proved to be extremely important in my career as an Account Executive. Throughout my college and professional career, I have grown into a polished, knowledgeable individual with a love of the advertising world. This passion fueled my drive even through the hard times, giving me strength and perseverance at school and at work.

Thank you for your time and consideration of me as a candidate for the Account Executive position at Crane & Jenkins. I look forward to hearing more about the position. I am confident that my education and experience will make me successful as an Account Executive.
