Some roles may even require a particular degree, and your resume is the best place to show that you have it.In this article, we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss how to format the education section of your resume (and where you should position it), as well as walk through some specific educational situations.How to format your education sectionThere\xe2\x80\x99s more than one way to format your education section, depending on the amount of work experience you have and what details may be most relevant to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for. For each school you have attended, consider including some combination of the following (always include the three bolded items):School nameDegree obtainedLocationDates attended or graduation dateField of study (major and minors)GPA if it was above 3.5\xc2\xa0Honors, achievements, relevant coursework, extracurricular activities, or study abroad programsHere are some tips to keep in mind as you format this section of your resume:List in reverse chronological order.Rank your highest degrees first and continue in reverse chronological order. And remember, when ranking your educational achievements, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to list your high school graduation if you have completed a college degree. If you haven't completed college, list your high school education.Make it relevant.Employers want to see that your education meets the requirements listed in their job post. They will also look to see that you have the certifications they require for the job. Study the job listing for the role you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for to help guide what to highlight. Make sure to include anything listed under the \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d sections of a job listing.\xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for a nursing job, for example, you may be required to have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN). Since the field of study is key, you may choose to list your degree first and institution second, like this:Bachelor of Science in Nursing, 2019 Arizona State University | Tempe, AZIf your degree isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly relevant to the job but you graduated from a prestigious university, consider listing the institution name first:Dartmouth College | Hanover, NHBachelor of Arts in Philosophy, 2006-2010Consider your work experience.In general, the more work experience you have, the less detail you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to include in this section. If you just graduated, for example, you may choose to include your GPA and highlight that you were the president of the National Honor Society (particularly if you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for a job where leadership skills are important). If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the workforce for several years, the school name, location, and degree will likely suffice.\xc2\xa0If you graduated more than five years ago, consider leaving off your graduation date to help avoid age discrimination.Keep your formatting consistent.While there are many different ways to format the contents of your education, consistency between each is key. Once you decide on a format, stick with it for your entire resume.\xc2\xa0Keep it concise.In many cases, the education section should be one of the shortest on your resume.\xc2\xa0How to handle unique education situationsWhile many resumes will have straightforward education sections, some will have an incomplete or complex education history. Thankfully, there are easy ways to ensure that your resume showcases your positive qualities and qualifications.Incomplete educationIf your resume will include any incomplete education, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to avoid words like \xe2\x80\x9cunfinished\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cincomplete\xe2\x80\x9d that could cast a negative shadow over your qualifications.\xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of completing your degree, include your expected graduation date. This lets employers know that you are still working on your degree while avoiding any confusion or misrepresentation of your qualifications. For example:University of MichiganBS in Computer Science candidateExpected to graduate in 2023\xc2\xa03.9 GPAIf you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering how to list education on your resume when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a degree, there\xe2\x80\x99s a format for that, too. Say you\xe2\x80\x99ve completed part of a degree, but do not intend to finish. You can still use it on your resume. List the number of credit hours completed toward a degree in place of graduation date, and include any courses relevant to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for.University of MichiganCompleted 30 credit hours toward a BS in Computer ScienceRelevant coursework: Web development, Object-oriented programming, Agile software projectsIf you have not attended college but have completed trade school or a certification program, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to include that information under the education section of your resume. Listing certifications as a graduate can be beneficial, too. This shows employers that you are continually learning and staying up to date with trends and technology.Complex educationWhether you attended multiple schools to earn one degree or earned multiple degrees from multiple schools, listing your education is only as complex as its formatting.Attending a few different colleges before landing at the one you graduated from does not mean you have to list every school. Employers are mainly interested in the school from which your degree was earned. It is, however, a good idea to list every school that you have received a degree from.If you have earned multiple degrees at the same level, you should list all of them. In terms of order, it is okay to list either your most recent or most relevant first.\xc2\xa0Where to place your education sectionWhere you place the education section on your resume depends on a few different factors: your education history, your work history, and the job for which you are applying.If you are a recent graduate with minimal work history, it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to list your education first. Education will be your more impressive section, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll want it to be the first seen when employers are viewing your application.\xc2\xa0If you are pursuing a job that requires a particular degree or credential, you should also list your education first. Employers will be interested in making sure you have those certifications before moving forward with your resume.If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working for several years, your work history is likely more relevant than your education history, so it may make sense to list it first. This is particularly true if the field of study of our degree isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly relevant to the job or industry you\xe2\x80\x99re targeting.Resume vs. curriculum vitaeIf you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for a PhD or research program or a job in academia, you may be asked to submit a curriculum vitae, or CV, instead of a resume. If this is the case, your education section should come before your work experience. CVs are generally longer than resumes, so you can include your complete academic history, including all certifications and achievements.Next steps\xc2\xa0A resume is an important document intended to organize and exemplify your education history, work experience, qualifications, and skills. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to include your completed Coursera courses or certificates to your resume.
