The information you include\xe2\x80\x94and choose to leave out\xe2\x80\x94will present a narrative about your experience, qualifications, and achievements.\n\n\n\nThe resume experience section is key to this story. It provides detailed information about your employment history. This is the real heart of your resume, and the more years you have been employed, the more decisions you will have to make about what to include and what to leave off in this section.\n\n\n   What's Included in the Experience Section of a Resume  \n\nThis section of your resume is where employers will look to see what jobs and job titles you've held in the past, providing them with an informative picture of your career arc.\n\n\n\nIdeally, you want the experience section of your resume to demonstrate growth. Throughout your career so far, you've almost certainly added skills, experience, and responsibility. This section will highlight how you've developed as a candidate, as well as provide a sense that you're an ambitious person who's always learning.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nIf your career path has taken some twists and turns, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry\xe2\x80\x94even a zig-zag path can demonstrate growth.\n\n\nSome of the strongest candidates are those who\xe2\x80\x99ve added skills in other, seemingly unrelated fields. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about how you present the information. It\xe2\x80\x99s also fine to leave out jobs that don\xe2\x80\x99t fit the story you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tell the hiring manager.\n\n\n   How to Write the Experience Section  \n\nList the companies you worked for, dates of employment, the positions you held, and brief descriptions of your work responsibilities, enriched with keywords and enhanced with bulleted lists of quantifiable achievements.\n\n\n\nThis work history is typically presented in reverse chronological order, beginning with your current job, and working back in time. Internships, summer jobs, and temporary jobs, in addition to permanent positions, can all be included in this part of your resume.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nYou do not have to include every job that you have held, especially if you have several years of experience or have worked in unrelated fields.\n\n\nEntry-level employees, who do not have a lot of on-the-job experience, should include every job possible while emphasizing the skills that match the job listing. But once you have worked for more than 10 years, you may find that some of your earlier jobs are less relevant to your career. You can leave those positions off, or group together earlier experience in a very truncated format at the end of your resume.\n\n\n\nHere are two examples of how early jobs can be listed on your resume:\n\n\n\nAdditional experience includes retail sales jobs at Barry's Books (20XX-20XX), Cindy's Clothing Store (20XX-20XX), and waitressing at Muffins and More (20XX-20XX).Additional experience includes early roles at ABC Company and XYZ company.\n\n\n   How Much Experience to List  \n\nTypically, a resume will have information about your most recent 10 to 15 years of experience. Beyond that timeframe, you do not need to include details unless the positions are relevant to your current career.\n\n\n\nIn some industries, including experience that dates back more than 10 or 15 years can actually hurt candidates. For example, in tech, including jobs that focused on older, outdated technologies might make a candidate look stuck in the past, even if they\xe2\x80\x99ve kept their skills current.\n\n\n   Writing Resume Job Descriptions  \n\nFor each company you have worked for, you will want to provide your title, the company's name and location, the years you were employed, and a short summary of your responsibilities and accomplishments.\n\n\n\nAvoid making the mistake of simply listing tasks. You want to use this section to highlight your abilities and accomplishments. Use resume action words and focus on demonstrating that you helped the company solve its problems and achieve its goals; bonus points if you can do so with a dollar sign attached. These highlighted achievements will \xe2\x80\x9cpop\xe2\x80\x9d on the page if you separate them, using bullets, from the descriptions of your work responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also a smart strategy to boldface dollar figures, growth percentages, or other key accomplishments.\n\n   Resume Experience Section Examples  \n\nHere are two examples of how to write resume experience sections.\n\n\n  Entry-Level Experience Section Sample  \n\nThis is for an entry-level job candidate. Here, instead of using the heading \xe2\x80\x9cProfessional Experience,\xe2\x80\x9d one can use the broader caption \xe2\x80\x9cExperience Highlights\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which allows the inclusion of a description of recent college training:\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience HighlightsUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WAStudent\xc2\xa0~ Environmental Science (9/20XX to 6/20XX)Successfully completed comprehensive course of study in environmental science, laying solid groundwork for career in environmental restoration. Key coursework included: Environmental Biology, Geology and Soils, Air Pollution Meteorology, Waste Treatment Technology, and Ecology.Internships:Acme Environmental Consulting\xc2\xa0(Spring 20XX): Honed expertise in soil sampling, documentation, and client relations during internship with established environmental consulting firm.Hamilton Mine Rehabilitation\xc2\xa0Project (Fall 20XX, Winter 20XX): Under the direction of faculty advisor Dr. Sarah Rose, participated in $1.4 million reclamation project to reclaim mercury-contaminated mining field.Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park Service, CaliforniaPark Guide / Trail Laborer\xc2\xa0(Summers 20XX and 20XX)Provided nature enrichment workshops and led park tours for park visitors; ensured timely maintenance of trails and park facilities.Rehired based on proven teamwork, work ethic, and customer service excellence.Played key role in restoring 18-mile wilderness trail destroyed during wildfires.\n\n  Experienced Candidate Experience Section Sample  \n\nThis is a sample work experience section written for a tech professional. Note that it is strengthened using a brief description of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s technical proficiencies. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also see how the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s current position is written using present tense, while her previous position employs past tense.\n\n\n\n\n\nABC Tech Innovation, Syracuse, NYSoftware Programmer\xc2\xa0(9/20XX to Present)Core Technologies: Clarion, C++, Visual Basic, Windows Server operating systemsServe as team lead for software application development in Clarion.

A resume template can help guide you toward choosing a design that works for you.\n\n\n\nWhatever style and format you select, make sure to be consistent. If you are using bullet points to describe your most recent position, you should use bullet points to describe each position you have held. If you have the years that you worked left-aligned for one job, make sure that you follow that same alignment for every position listed in the section.\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe resume experience section provides detailed information about your work history, including job titles, job descriptions, and achievements.Quantify your accomplishments by using numbers, percentages, and dollars earned or saved.Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to leave off unrelated work experience if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit the story that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tell about your work experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Each Part of a Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Include Part-Time Work on a Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Include in a Resume Career Highlights Section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry-Level Resume Examples and Writing Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Build a Resume in 7 Easy Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for What to Include in a Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it OK for My Resume to Be 2 Pages?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Resume Example With a Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Include in a Combination Resume With Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Make Your Resume Work History Look Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Difference Between a Resume and a Curriculum Vitae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to List an Internship on a Resume (With Examples)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Resume Template for Students and Graduates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I Leave a Job Off My Resume?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Include a GPA on Your Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Student Resume Example With Summary Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudgeting\n\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\n\nMortgages\n\n\n\nEconomics\n\n\n\nBanking\n\n\n\nSmall Business\n\n\n\nFinancial Terms Dictionary\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nEditorial Guidelines\nTerms of Service\nDiversity and Inclusion Pledge\nAdvertise\nCareers\nContact\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Balance is part of the Dotdash Meredith publishing family.\n\n\nPlease review our updated Terms of Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking \xe2\x80\x9cAccept All Cookies\xe2\x80\x9d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.
