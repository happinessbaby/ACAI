   \n\n Writing a resume is never easy, but one of the hardest pieces to put together is the resume objective.\n    This problem is compounded if you\xe2\x80\x99re writing the objective for an entry-level position, when you still might have no real idea what it is that you do want out of the kind of job you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get.\n    It takes a solid understanding not only of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done and what the company you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to is looking for, but also of what you want out of a career at all.\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\nResume objectives are short statements are the top of your resume that describe who you are, what makes you qualified, and what you have to offer for your potential employer.\n\n\nEvery resume objective should be unique and tailored to a specific application.\n\n\nUse keywords and action verbs to make your objective clear and concise.\n\n\nResume objectives are different than resume summaries. A resume objective is more future oriented, while a resume summary focuses on past experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn This Article   \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSkip to section\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat Is a Resume Objective?Tips for Writing an Entry-Level Resume ObjectiveHow to Write Resume Objectives for Entry-Level PositionsExamples of Entry-Level Resume ObjectivesResume Objective vs. Resume Summary StatementResume Objective Frequently Asked QuestionsFinal ThoughtsSign Up For More Advice and JobsShow MoreWhat Is a Resume Objective?\n\n    In a nutshell, resume objectives are pithy statements at the top of a resume that detail a few of your accomplishments, describe who you are to a company, and show them what you have to offer.\n    Lots of people skip this part of a resume \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to blame them. After all, the most important things about a resume are your skills and work experiences, right?\n    That\xe2\x80\x99s true \xe2\x80\x94 the biggest things that hiring managers look for are your skills and experiences. But a resume objective lets you take a little more control over your own story.\n    Rather than flatly listing the things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done or the positions you\xe2\x80\x99ve held, a resume objective lets you frame your experiences, putting them into the sort of context that a hiring manager might find appealing.\n    It\xe2\x80\x99s a small thing to add an objective to a resume, but it can mean all the difference in separating your resume out from the pack.\n Tips for Writing an Entry-Level Resume Objective\nNow that you’ve got a general idea for how to write an entry-level resume objective, let’s turn to some actionable tips to make yours even better:\n\n\nRead the job description carefully. Writing the perfect resume objective is all about being a good close reader. Try to understand what the recruiter or hiring manager is looking for in a job candidate based on your close reading, and then customize your resume objective (and the rest of your resume) to match those expectations.\n\n\nUse keywords. As you review the job description, highlight action verbs in one color and adjectives in a different color. Then, try to weave those words into your resume objective naturally. Don’t worry about stuffing keywords too much here — you have the rest of your resume for that\n\n\nAnswer: who are you? The primary function of an objective is to quickly communicate who you are and what you want. Anyone who reads your objective should have an immediate understanding of your background and why you fit in the industry/role you’re applying for.\n\n\nKeep your objective clear. This is a resume “objective” after all. Any recruiter or hiring manager who reads your objective should know what it is you want and how you could positively influence the company by achieving your own goals. If your goals sound natural, positive, and enthusiastic, you can expect more calls for interviews.\n\n\nUse strong action words. If you spend too much time describing your experience with wishy-washy language, employers won’t be able to see all the value you can provide. Instead, use strong action words like “leveraged,” “developed,” “managed,” and countless others.\n\n\nShowcase your best qualities. If you’re seeking an entry-levle position, the chances are you don’t have a wealth of experience in the field or industry. Don’t let that get you down — you can use your resume objective to bring attention to your reliability and adaptability to highlight how you’re a fast learner and dependable worker. Work ethic counts for a lot when it comes to entry-level roles.\n\n\nKeep it short. A resume objective shouldn’t be any longer than three sentences, and usually two sentences is plenty to say what you need to say. That’s why choosing impactful words is so important — each and every one counts.\n\n\nHow to Write Resume Objectives for Entry-Level Positions\n    So now that we know why they\xe2\x80\x99re important, how are you supposed to write one? Specifically, how do you write a resume objective for a job that\xe2\x80\x99s ostensibly entry-level?\n    You won\xe2\x80\x99t have a ton of experience at your disposal just yet, given that you\xe2\x80\x99re just entering a field, so for some people, it can feel a little defeatist to have to write an objective for a job that you have no practical understanding of.\n    But that\xe2\x80\x99s just why the objective is so important \xe2\x80\x94 if your experience seems irrelevant to you, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance it\xe2\x80\x99ll seem that way to a recruiter or hiring manager as well.\n    It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you to show them just how relevant it is.\n    With all that in mind, here are a few dos and don\xe2\x80\x99ts to help you on your way to writing your own resume objective:\nDo:\n\n\nThink about your goals. What are you hoping to get out of this job? How can you spin those goals in a way that shows what kind of value you can add to a company?\n\n\nThink about where you\xe2\x80\x99ve already been. As we said, it might not be immediately obvious how your previous work experience fits into the job you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get, but a resume objective gives you the chance to explain yourself.\n\n\nThink about the job itself that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get. What makes an ideal candidate in this field? Who is the hiring manager looking for? How can you sell yourself as being one of these ideal candidates?\n\n\nDon’t:\n\n\nFocus too heavily on yourself. Your goals are important, but for the moment, all the hiring manager is thinking about is how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to add value to a company.\n\n\nForget to be as specific as you can when it comes to your goals. Vagueness will get your resume thrown out.\n\n\nUse the same resume objective for every job you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to.You should be altering your entire resume for every individual application \xe2\x80\x94 so if you\xe2\x80\x99re not changing your objective statement at all, then there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with your application process.\n\n\nExamples of Entry-Level Resume Objectives\n    Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough just to read about something \xe2\x80\x94 many of us out there are a little more visual when it comes to our learning processes.\n    So here are a few example resume statements for a few different kinds of entry-level positions to help get you started:\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeking to achieve a sales position at a growing organization in order to contribute my own skills and expertise toward the company\xe2\x80\x99s expansion while also developing my own career.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Dedicated professional with a passion for childhood development. Seeking employment in an entry-level role that allows me to supervise and encourage children in educational activities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Natural people-person looking for a customer service position that will allow me to leverage my interpersonal skills to communicate with clients from diverse backgrounds. Enjoys solving problems and putting smiles on people’s faces.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Recent graphic design-graduate hoping to secure a position working to develop graphics for website design and improved user experience. Penchant for putting quality first in all endeavors.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo secure an entry-level content writing position with a larger company that will foster career growth while giving me the chance to work within an existing organizational structure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFresh BU graduate looking for video editing position where I can challenge myself while working towards the goals of a larger team.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nResume Objective vs. Resume Summary Statement\nWhile both resume objectives and resume summary statements are used as a sort of sales pitch for recruiters and hiring managers, there are some major differences.\nA resume objective discusses where you’d like to be in your career and gives a brief sketch of why you think you’re ready to be at that point. While you do use examples of your past success (college degree, soft skills, etc.), a resume objective is more future-oriented.\nA resume summary statement, on the other hand, focuses on your impressive work history that aligns with the job you’re applying for. It proves that you’ve had similar responsibilities in the past and are therefore fully capable of performing the job. A resume summary focuses on past results as an indication of future success.\nBoth should include keywords and paint you as the perfect candidate. Most experts agree that a resume summary statement is more impactful, but for entry-level job seekers and career-changers, an objective can also be a powerful way to show that you have what it takes to perform a job.\nResume Objective Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nShould I use a resume summary or a resume objective?\n\nUse a resume objective when you are a recent graduate or entering a new career, but for all other cases, stick with a resume summary.  Resume objectives are good when you do not have a lot of professional experience. \nHowever, a resume summary is better to use once you have enough experience. This is because hiring managers are more interested in your proven qualifications rather than your goals. They want to see what you can do for them. /p>\n\nHow long should a resume objective be?\n\nA resume objective should be no more than two sentences. You want to get to the meat of your resume, and since a resume objective is future oriented, it only serves to present your goals, but not your proven qualifications. Think of the resume objective as a quick intro that you use to lead into the rest of your resume.\n\nWhat is a good objective for a resume?\n\nA good resume objective is one that is unique and enticing. You want to show to the hiring manager that you are a special candidate worthy of consideration. Therefore, have your resume objective highlight some endearing qualities, such as persistence in the face of challenge or a desire to improve yourself and your company, while also providing information specific to you.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n    Just keep in mind when it comes to resume statements that one thing matters most of all: Specificity!\n    Whatever value you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing to a company shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be vague \xe2\x80\x94 it should be as concrete as possible, while leaving open the idea that there is even more you could do to help a company beyond what you\xe2\x80\x99ve stated in your objective.\n    Best of luck!\n           How useful was this post?
