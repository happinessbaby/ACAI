You may have never worked in your life or have had so many past jobs that you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know which you should include.In either case, there\xe2\x80\x99s a right and wrong way to create this section.So, which parts of your professional experience should you include? Which parts should you excludeThis guide offers tips on exactly what experience to put on a resume and how to write a work experience section that will attract a potential employer\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  Create your resume now  How To Show Your Professional Experience On Your ResumeThis core part of your resume can be titled in a variety of ways. A few common examples are:Most employers deem the work experience section the most vital part of your resume, as your career path is often the clearest, most efficient way to explain your skills. It lists companies you\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for, industries you are familiar with, skills you have acquired, and the contributions you\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered along the way.Here are some ideas for section titles:Work ExperienceProfessional ExperienceRelevant ExperienceWork HistoryChoose a title that is most appropriate for your experience. For example, students may include internships or part-time positions, which qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d experience but are not related to their target roles.A title such as \xe2\x80\x9cWork Experience\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWork History\xe2\x80\x9d would suffice in this case, to show that you have consistently been employed.As a cheat code try using an online resume builder which includes helpful examples and practical tips for adding the experience section on your resume.What To Include In A Resume Experience SectionIt\xe2\x80\x99s best to collect all of your work histories first before starting to write your experience section.For most job seekers, their work experience will be true professional jobs/positions. But for students or recent graduates, relevant work can also include:InternshipsVolunteer workStudy abroad programsLeaderships in clubs or community teamsNext, it is time to detail your experience. Start with your most recent position and work backward.Each job post should include the following elements:Job titleEmployer/company nameLocation (City, State or \xe2\x80\x9cremote\xe2\x80\x9d)Dates of employmentDetails of your accomplishments and contributionsSome of these details are unnecessary in functional resume layouts. For example, in cases where you may have large gaps in your job history, a functional resume layout can help downplay the scattered timeline of your employment and highlight the skills you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned and will bring to the next position.Most importantly, each job post should include a brief paragraph, or more commonly, a bullet-point list of your responsibilities. Each position listed should prioritize your achievements and contributions to the role. Do not simply list the \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdaily tasks\xe2\x80\x9d of the job.Include quantifiable examples of your success, as 34% of recruiters won\xe2\x80\x99t consider applications that are not specific to the role, according to CareerBuilder.Keep your experience section as focused as possible and only list those statements which are relevant to your target jobs. Forbes Magazine suggests limiting yourself to five bullet points per position.Action verbs can significantly increase the impact your resume content has on the reader, enticing them enough to reach out for an interview. Include a variety of action verbs in each of your bullet points.Examples of effective action verbs to use on your resume: launched; implemented; spearheaded; coordinated; directed; increased; restructured; acquired; grew; saved; cut; identified, etc.How To Write The Work Experience Section On Your ResumeOne of the easiest ways to capture the attention of a hiring manager is to list your professional experience in a clear, concise, and visually interesting manner.Top tip: your work experience section should always follow a reverse chronological frame, regardless of the resume format you choose (chronological, combined, or functional).It\xe2\x80\x99s essential to know exactly how to write experience in a resume. To start, begin with the most recent position held and work backward in time.How you display this information is crucial. An inconsistent, out-of-order format will only confuse the reader and earn your resume a trip to the trash bin.As with every section on your resume, make sure to highlight information that explains your past accomplishments, successes, contributions, and learnings.For example, these can be:Customer satisfaction percentage or scoreTotal sales you madeClients attended toAnything that you can show you were a success will look great.The more your past triumphs can relate to the position at hand, the better.What Is an Example of Work Experience?You may be wondering how one of your former positions, duties, and accomplishments should look on a resume.
