Does your resume contain any of these common mistakes? \n  The Two Biggest Resume Mistakes on Dates \n  Did you know that writing your dates as two digits (\xe2\x80\x9915) rather than four digits (2015) makes them invisible to the ATS (applicant tracking system)? \n  \n    If the dates on your resume are formatted wrong, you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially sending out a resume with zero work experience on it. \n   \n  If the dates are on the left margin of your resume, the ATS can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize your work experience, either. The ATS reads your work experience by scanning for a company name followed by dates and a job title in close proximity. If the dates come first, again, the ATS sees you as never having worked a day in your life. \n  I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather see you get credit for all your hard work! \n  Let the ATS Do the Math \n  While we\xe2\x80\x99re on the topic of dates, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to begin your summary with \xe2\x80\x9cDynamic executive with 20+ years of experience in the chemical industry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \n  I can almost hear you saying \xe2\x80\x9cBut, but \xe2\x80\xa6 lots of employers specify X years of experience in the job posting!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, they do. However the ATS is much more sophisticated than a few years ago. It will actually calculate your years of work experience by subtracting the beginning date from the end date on each job. \n  That means when an HR executive looks at a stack of resumes, every one of them will be from a candidate who meets all the minimum requirements for the job, including years of experience. \n  \n    Don\'t waste the most valuable real estate on your resume telling the hiring executive something he or she already knows. \n   \n  Instead, use that valuable real estate at the top of your resume for a branding statement that describes the unique value you present to an employer, rather than how you meet the minimum job requirements. \n  Do you ever worry about age discrimination? (If you\'re 39 or older, you probably should!) Listing "20 years of experience" when the job posting requires only "11 years of experience" can make you a target for age discrimination.  \n  Pro Resume Writer Tips \n  As a professional resume writer, I seldom put months on the resume because if you are in a job interview, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you answering questions about why you left one job in April and didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the next until July. \n  Instead, I want you answering questions about how you saved the company $250K or ignited 17% revenue growth or transformed customer engagement. \n   I usually list dates as years only (2012-2013), which creates the appearance of a continuous work history. \n  \n    If you started a job in December 2012 and left in January 2013, omitting the months gives you almost two years of work history rather than two months. \n   \n  De-emphasize Problem Dates  \n  There\xe2\x80\x99s also a professional resume writer strategy to use if your dates are a bit problematic \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s say you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple of jobs that didn\xe2\x80\x99t last three years each. Or maybe you are not currently working, and prefer not to advertise that fact. \n  You can put the company name on the left margin, followed by the dates, with the city and state on the right margin. The ATS will still be able to read your work experience, but the dates will be a little less noticeable for employers during that crucial first six-second scan. \n  The job search is enough of a challenge, so don\xe2\x80\x99t let your resume work against you! \n    \n  Do you have a question about resumes or the job search? Add it to comments (or send me a private Inmail) and I may write about it in the future, either on LinkedIn or on the Thrive! Blog at thriveresumes.com.  \n  Share this and magical unicorns will dance in your garden.

So saying "I don\'t like ATS" is a bit like saying "I don\'t like cell phones." The technology is here to stay, it\'s up to us to use it well or poorly.\n \n\n            \n      \n \n          \n        \n\n              \n                \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Like\n    \n  \n\n              \n\n                \n                \n                  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Reply\n    \n  \n\n                \n                \n                  1 Reaction\n                \n              \n                2 Reactions\n              \n        \n      \n        \n      \n  \n  \n            \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n      \n  \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n                  \n                    Neil B.
